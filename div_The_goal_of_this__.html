<div>The goal of this thesis is to increase the transparency of political decision-making and thus trust in political parties. In order to reach this goal I imagine a participatory online platform where politicans, officials and citizens can interact directly within a flat hierarchy. It is therefore a task to develop a concept for a platform which enables to build a well formed online community for interaction within the context of politics. It has to be examined which generall aspects of community building have to be considered. Furthermore existing mechanisms and pitfalls have to be identified by analysing existing platforms.<br></div>
