<div><u>Encouraging contributions</u><br></div><div>Contribution is the heart of each community. Kraut and Resnick therefore
 explored methods for encouraging and maximizing contribution amongst 
others linked to theories of motivation in social psychnology. As 
successful examples for contribution Kraut and Resnick list the open 
source software community Apache, the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia. 
But it is also outlined that volunteers often leave tasks undone they 
find unappealing. That's why companies often have paid employees which 
handle neccesary tasks. They mention classic Expectancy-Value models (V.
 Vroom, Porter, &amp; Lawler, 2005) where motivation is a multiplicative
 function of expectancy and value with a two-stage process where 
individual effort has some impact on performance (e.x. completed 
features of a software product), and performance has some impact on 
outcomes (e.x. acknowledgement of community). The satisfaction resulting
 from outcome can lay in intrinsic and extrinsiv motivation (Burke &amp;
 Kraut, 2008). The further discussion of the social psychology of 
"collective effort" is rooted in a 1993 review paper by Karau and 
Williams's work on social loafing and their attempts to understand and 
promote individuals to make substantive contributions when in groups 
rather than depend on the efforts of others. The overall emphasis of the
 chapter is on motivating individuals to make the maximum meaningful 
contribution they can, motivated through clever software design, task 
structures, and reward architectures<br></div>
