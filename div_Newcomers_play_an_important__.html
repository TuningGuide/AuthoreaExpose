<div>Newcomers play an important role to the community. They restock leaving members or contribute in growth. On the other hand they have to accustom to the norms of the group and while doing so may be antagonizing long-established members. The book focusses on the experiences of newcomers and the experiences of current members, durring the evolvement from "reader-to-leader" [Preece09]. For newcomers it is important to keep the entry barrier low but still introduce them via initiation rituals and welcoming practices.<br></div>
