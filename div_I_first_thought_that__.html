<div>I first thought that it would be possible to use a localised platform like politics.stackexchange.com (see subchapter Multi-Purpose-Platforms) but then realised that politics is not only about information and solutions but also compromise and agreement. StackExchange sites focus on one interest: giving the best possible answer of course it can be opinion based but there is only one interest. In politics you have users with differering interests which makes it much harder to design a simple process to meet the interests of a maximised number of users.<br></div>
